# Seasonal job matching platform



\## Project Overview



This is the graduation project for developing a \*\*Seasonal Job Matching Platform\*\*. The platform aims to efficiently connect employers offering short-term and seasonal job opportunities with jobseekers actively looking for such roles.



This project will involve designing and implementing a comprehensive, multi-platform system: a web application for employers, a mobile application for jobseekers, and a robust backend infrastructure that powers an intelligent matching engine.

\## 🚀 Key System Components \& Features



The platform is divided into three major functional areas:



\### 1. Web Application (For Employers)

This application will be the primary interface for businesses and individuals offering seasonal work.



\* \*\*Job Management:\*\* Post new jobs, edit existing listings, and archive completed ones.

\* \*\*Application Management:\*\* View and filter applications, review candidate documents.

\* \*\*Analytics:\*\* Basic dashboards for tracking job post performance and application status.



\### 2. Mobile Application (For Jobseekers)

This application will focus on providing a seamless experience for finding and applying for jobs on the go.



\* \*\*Profile Creation:\*\* Easy profile setup and management.

\* \*\*Document Upload:\*\* Ability to upload CVs or ID documents directly using the device's camera or photo library.

\* \*\*Job Discovery \& Application:\*\* Search, filter, and apply for relevant jobs.

\* \*\*Notifications:\*\* Receive \*\*push notifications\*\* for application status updates and new job recommendations.



\### 3. Backend \& Infrastructure

The core engine that powers the entire platform.



\* \*\*APIs \& Database:\*\* Provides all necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs for both web and mobile clients, managing authentication, user data, job listings, and application flows.

\* \*\*Intelligent Matching Engine:\*\* The core innovation—a hybrid recommendation system using \*\*full-text search\*\* and potentially \*\*embeddings\*\* to provide highly relevant job recommendations to candidates and filter the best applicants for employers.

\* \*\*DevOps \& Quality Assurance:\*\* Ensures continuous integration, deployment, and testing for a stable and reliable service.

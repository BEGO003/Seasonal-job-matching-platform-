# User Story: Profile Creation & Viewing (Mobile)

## 1. Overview
This user story focuses on enabling users to create and view their personal profiles within the mobile application. The primary goal is to establish a basic user profile management system, allowing users to input essential personal information and review it. This initial implementation specifically excludes resume management functionalities, which will be addressed in a separate story.

## 2. Features

### UI/UX
-   **Profile Screen Navigation:** Users can access their profile screen from the main application navigation.
-   **View Profile Data:** Display of current user profile information such including (but not limited to):
    -   Full Name
    -   Email Address
    -   Phone Number
    -   Date of Birth
    -   Address (City, State, Country)
    -   Profile Picture (placeholder initially, upload functionality to be added later)
-   **Edit Profile Data:** An "Edit Profile" button or similar mechanism to switch the profile view into an editable state.
-   **Form Input Fields:** Clearly labeled and intuitive input fields for each piece of profile information.
    -   Text fields for Name, Email, Phone, Address details.
    -   Date picker for Date of Birth.
-   **Save/Cancel Changes:** Buttons to "Save" new or updated profile information and "Cancel" to discard changes.
-   **Feedback Mechanisms:** Visual feedback (e.g., toast messages, loading indicators) for successful profile updates or errors.
-   **Responsive Design:** The profile screen should be responsive and adapt well to various mobile screen sizes and orientations.

## 3. Implementation
-   **Frontend (Flutter):**
    -   Develop the `ProfileScreen` widget to display and allow editing of user information.
    -   Utilize `TextFormField` widgets for input fields with appropriate validation.
    -   Implement state management (e.g., Provider, Riverpod) to handle profile data, form state, and loading states.
    -   Integrate with `DatePicker` for date of birth selection.
    -   Develop a `ProfilePicture` widget (initially displaying a default avatar, with future plans for image upload).
    -   Implement navigation logic to and from the profile screen.
-   **Backend (API Integration):**
    -   Integrate with existing authentication services for user identification.
    -   Develop API calls to fetch user profile data (`GET /api/user/profile`).
    -   Develop API calls to update user profile data (`PUT /api/user/profile`).
    -   Handle API responses, including success and error states.
-   **Data Storage:**
    -   Utilize existing data models for `PersonalInformationModel` (from `lib/models/profile_screen_models/personal_information_model.dart`).
    -   Ensure data persistence for user profiles (backend database).
-   **Error Handling:**
    -   Implement client-side form validation for all input fields.
    -   Gracefully handle API errors and display user-friendly messages.
-   **Testing:**
    -   Write unit tests for profile data models, providers, and services.
    -   Write widget tests for the `ProfileScreen` to ensure UI/UX functionality.
    -   Write integration tests for the profile creation and viewing flow.
